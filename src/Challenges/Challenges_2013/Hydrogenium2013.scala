//There is no food in your fridge and you are hungry. You want to go to a local store and buy some food. You have to hurry as some of the shops will close soon.
//There are N squares in your neighborhood and M direct roads connecting them. The squares are numbered from 0 to N − 1. You are living in square 0 and can reach it in 0 seconds. The stores are located in the squares, one in each of them. You are given a map of the neighborhood in the form of four zero-indexed arrays A, B, C and D. Each of the arrays A, B, C contains M integers, while D contains N integers.
//For each I (0 ≤ I < M), the walking distance between squares A[I] and B[I] is C[I] seconds (in either direction).
//There can be multiple roads connecting the same pair of squares, or a road with both ends entering the same square.
//It is possible that some roads go through tunnels or over bridges (that is, the graph of squares and roads doesn't have to be planar).
//It is not guaranteed that you are able to reach all the squares.
//For each J (0 ≤ J < N), the shop at square J will close in D[J] seconds (if D[J] = −1, then the store is already closed);
//it is possible to buy the food even if you reach the shop at the very last second, when it closes.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(A: Array[Int], B: Array[Int], C: Array[Int], D: Array[Int]): Int }
//that, given arrays A, B, C and D, returns the minimum time (in seconds) needed to reach an open store. If it is impossible, it should return −1.
//For example, given:
//  A[0] = 0    B[0] = 1    C[0] = 2    D[0] = -1
//  A[1] = 1    B[1] = 2    C[1] = 3    D[1] = 1
//  A[2] = 3    B[2] = 2    C[2] = 4    D[2] = 3
//  A[3] = 1    B[3] = 3    C[3] = 5    D[3] = 8
//  A[4] = 2    B[4] = 0    C[4] = 7
//  A[5] = 2    B[5] = 1    C[5] = 5
//
//the function should return 7. To reach the closest open shop you should follow the path: 0 −> 1 −> 3.
//However, if given, for example:
//  A[0] = 0     D[0] = -1
//  B[0] = 1     D[1] = 6
//  C[0] = 10    D[2] = 8
//the function should return −1, as you will not be able to reach square 1 in less than 10 seconds, and you cannot reach square 2 at all.
//Assume that:
//N is an integer within the range [1..100];
//M is an integer within the range [0..N**2];
//each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [0..N − 1];
//each element of array C is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
//each element of array D is an integer within the range [−1..1,000,000,000].
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(N2);
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(N2), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
//Elements of input arrays can be modified.
